# DEPRECATED

After using this for a while, we've found too many situations where it reloads when we don't want it to (such as when using openModal and closing a child modal window).

Our new recommendation is to check and reload _only_ when the page is reloaded from a history entry. We plan to publish such a helper script in the future.
